## Input

There are 12 identical capacitive touch units, one for each key of the keyboard.

In this case, the MOSFET just connects to the resistor chain.

## Power Supply

See the [USB Type-C Power Only](../ingredients//usb.md#usb-c) circuit.

Additionally, we'll put in some through holes connected to VCC and Ground, so you can chain power between multiple musical keyboards without having to connect USB cables to each.

You can import TestPin from the system library of EasyEDA, or a pin in any other software.
